    <p class="textindent0">Most of us who have taught students about the material remains of the
      ancient world would agree that time in the past is harder to conceptualize
      than space in the past. This is especially true of the conventional
      temporal divisions -- "periods" -- we use to group and categorize the art,
      archaeological remains, and historical events of the ancient world. When
      asked to mark ancient places on a map, students excel. When asked to place
      objects within a historical, archaeological, or art-historical period and
      to assign a corresponding date range, however, the same students sometimes
      seem to be picking terms and dates at random. We can see ancient places
      inscribed in present spaces, and we can imagine ourselves in them. But
      ancient time undergoes a curious flattening process, in which developments
      that took place over centuries appear to have happened all at once in a
      great jumble. Introduce into this confusion the idea that "periods" are
      essentially arbitrary conventions about which scholars disagree, and many
      students will decide that the periodization of the ancient world is simply
      impossible to learn.</p>
    <p>Similar problems apply to the role of temporal divisions in the Linked
      Ancient World Data environment. Conceptual entities that we can associate
      with concrete physical manifestations -- people, places, texts -- have
      provided the foundations for a growing Linked Ancient World Data
      infrastructure in which it is increasingly easy to discover
      semantically-related information. Authoritative spatial gazetteers like
      the <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades platform</a> have not
      only made it possible to extract maps from texts by matching place names
      to geographic coordinates, they have also provided a conceptual connection
      that initiatives such as the <a href="http://pelagios-project.blogspot.com/">Pelagios
        Project</a> (Simon, Barker and Isaksen 2012) have been able to use to
      bring together material associated with the same site in different
      databases (for example, <a href="http://pelagios.dme.ait.ac.at/api/places/http%3A%2F%2Fpleiades.stoa.org%2Fplaces%2F579885">material
        associated with ancient Athens</a>). The use of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_identifier">Uniform
        Resource Identifiers</a> (URIs) for people, places, and things sidesteps
      the barriers to discovery created by the use of different metadata
      schemata, different vocabularies, or different languages. At the same
      time, however, it requires general agreement about the identity of the
      underlying entity: <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885">Athens</a>,
      <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885">Athenae</a>, <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885">Athen</a>,
      <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885">Afen</a>, <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885">Athina</a>
      have to refer to the same socio-political unit located at more or less the
      same geographic coordinates. </p>
    <p>Periods have been modeled as abstract components of formal ontologies
      (e.g. the CIDOC-CRM: <a href="http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crm-concepts/#_Toc224984167">http://www.cidoc-crm.org/crm-concepts/#_Toc224984167</a>;
      Doerr, Kritsotaki and Stead 2005; Doerr, Kritsotaki and Stead 2010), and
      directory or gazetteer-based approaches have been attempted on several
      occasions -- for example, in the Electronic Cultural Atlas Initiative
      (Petras et al. 2006) and the Common Eras project (Isaksen et al. 2009).
      But periods have proven to work poorly with Linked Data principles, which
      require well-defined entities for linking. As concepts of convenience,
      often invented by a single scholar in a seminal work but then modified and
      debated over long periods of time, deliberately left vague in temporal
      terms in order to protect their usefulness for relative chronologies,
      individual periods have no objective existence. Yet they are deeply
      entangled with both physical space and absolute time, the latter measured
      by concrete calendar systems and ultimately by the physical rotation of
      the earth and its movement around the sun. Particular period terms are
      associated with particular absolute dates in particular places; in turn,
      changes in the identity of a place at a particular geographic location can
      only be described in terms of the passage of time, often in the form of
      historical periodization.</p>
    <p>The creation of an agreed-upon controlled vocabulary for periods
      therefore requires either highly local definitions or definitions that are
      so broad and vague as to be all-encompassing. Both types exist: local
      vocabularies in use in the UK heritage community, for example, define the
      "Iron Age" as a period (presumably only in Britain) lasting from 800 BC to
      AD 43, the year of the Roman conquest (e.g. <a href="http://www.fish-forum.info/i_apl_e.htm">http://www.fish-forum.info/i_apl_e.htm</a>),
      while the Getty Thesaurus of Art &amp; Architecture, which seeks to offer
      more universal concepts, describes a global "<a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=iron+age&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;page=1&amp;subjectid=300019279">Iron
        Age</a>" in terms of the three-age system and notes generally that it
      has different dates in different places. It also offers a facet for the
      European Iron Age, which has several stylistic-chronological subgroups:
      here, the only value associated with Britain is the <a href="http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=iron+age&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;subjectid=300019384">La
        Tène period/culture</a>, which is placed in space in "Northern Europe
      and the British isles" and in time from "the mid-fifth century BCE" to the
      "mid-first century BCE". Though this definition and that of the UK
      heritage community overlap partially in time, space and concept, they
      employ different terms; conversely, a single period term such as "Iron
      Age" can change dramatically in meaning according to where it is used, or
      by whom. For Linked Data purposes, then, this is not a simple question of
      using URIs from a shared gazetteer to align different terms for the same
      period concept. A solution is needed that recognizes the fact that we
      often use different terms for the same time range or cultural phenomenon,
      while we also often use the same terms to describe time ranges or cultural
      phenomena that differ to varying degrees.</p>
    <p>I first encountered this problem during the development of <a href="http://geodia.laits.utexas.edu">GeoDia,
        an interactive spatial timeline of ancient Mediterranean history and
        archaeology</a> (Rabinowitz 2013). The original design was focused on
      archaeological and art-historical periodization, as a way to explain
      visually to students how ancient remains were grouped together (Figure 1).</p>

      <figure id="figure1">
      <img id="img1" src="figure1.jpg"/>
      <figcaption>Figure 1. View of Athens in GeoDia: location on map, periodization on
        timeline, images divided by period on right.</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>We began with the idea that we would have general, Getty-AAT-style periods
      that would then be attached to individual archaeological sites. But major
      problems with this approach soon began to emerge. Using a generic
      periodization meant, in some cases, that sites would be represented with
      periods that were not used to describe them in the literature. In other
      cases, it meant a conflict between the date-range of a period to be
      represented in the timeline and the history of a particular site. <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/433032">Pompeii</a>
      is a <a href="http://geodia.laits.utexas.edu/timemap.html#zoom=4&amp;center=36.8,17.18&amp;date=2013-09-18T11:12:21.686Z&amp;item_type=site&amp;cultures=&amp;regions=&amp;terms=pompeii&amp;site_period=&amp;removed=&amp;pleiades_uri=">good
        example</a>: though Pompeii exists during the more general "Flavian
      period", that site ends abruptly in AD 79, in the middle of that period,
      with the eruption of Vesuvius. The idiosyncrasies of particular regions
      and sites therefore led us to a data-model in which the basic unit was the
      "site period", in most cases a local manifestation, with a site-specific
      date range, of a more general period concept (Figure 2).</p>

    <figure id="figure2"><img id="img2" src="figure2.jpg"/>
      <figcaption>Figure 2. The GeoDia period data model.</figcaption>
      </figure>
 
    <p>Because GeoDia, as a synchronized mashup of a map and a timeline, relies
      on places with geographic coordinates, it was relatively easy to join the
      Linked Ancient World Data ecosystem, at least peripherally, by attaching
      Pleiades URIs to its sites. But it quickly became apparent that allowing
      links back in was impossible, because the interface does not display
      "places": it displays a dynamic combination of location and "site periods"
      drawn from separate tables in the underlying database. We could consume
      URIs, but we couldn't produce them. Furthermore, while Pleiades URIs could
      be pulled in on a semi-automatic basis, it was impossible to connect
      GeoDia periods or site periods with controlled vocabularies. It was
      therefore impossible to take advantage of the possibilities for automated
      data integration offered by Linked Data approaches -- for example, the
      association of Flickr photos with ancient places in Pleiades through the
      use of URI-based machine tags. Frustration with this situation led me to
      join what I soon realized was a growing chorus of voices calling for the
      better integration of time in spatial approaches to history (Gregory 2007,
      Berman 2011, Janowicz 2012, Elliott 2013, Grossner 2013). </p>
    <p>The addition of "when" to a Linked Ancient World Data landscape that
      currently focuses on "where" and "who" will not come, however, through the
      development of a consensus-based gazetteer for globally-recognized period
      concepts. Even if such a vocabulary could be developed, and even if a
      majority of data managers were to adopt it for future work (a big "if"),
      it could not be retrofitted to deal with the diversity of period
      definitions already present in existing print and digital resources
      without a significant loss of information. Furthermore, I do not think it
      is desirable to smooth out scholarly disagreements and differences
      regarding the definition of periods, for this discussion is a fundamental
      part of the rich history of scholarship on the ancient world. </p>
    <p>A solution to this problem must therefore take into account the diverse
      ways in which we use and understand periodization in our scholarship, and
      it must have the flexibility to accommodate conflicting or changing
      definitions for periods. At the same time, it should facilitate the
      discovery of the sorts of information people are likely to want to find
      using Linked Period Data. Three come immediately to mind: material from
      the same absolute date-range across datasets employing a variety of
      periodizations; information from spatially-linked datasets filtered by
      period; and conflicting definitions of periods proposed by different
      scholars. In the first case, one might wish to find all records associated
      with the range 400-300 BC from a series of datasets that use various
      period terms for the same span (Hellenistic, Classical, Late Classical,
      Early Republican, Iron Age, etc.). In the second, one might wish to see
      only records associated with <em>Classical</em> <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/579885">Athens</a>,
      or only references to the name used for a site in a given period (e.g.
      Cherson, the name used for <a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org/places/226564">Crimean
        Chersonesos</a> in the Middle Byzantine period), or only records
      associated with period terms used to describe remains in a particular
      geographic region. And in the third case, a user might want to compare
      different temporal spans assigned to the same period term in the same
      place (Figure 3). So a Linked Data resource for periods should include
      both the terms used to refer to periods and the coordinates used to
      describe them in time and space. In order to follow scholarly practice, it
      should also provide references to the source(s) from which those
      coordinates were derived.</p>

        concept "Iron Age" in the Levant, from Kreuger 2013.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    
    <p>It would be difficult, if not impossible, to provide a this information
      in a structured form in a top-down gazetteer of period concepts. Ryan
      Shaw, Eric Kansa and I, however, think that we have found a way to provide
      it in a bottom-up Linked Data gazetteer of period assertions -- that is, a
      set of stable references for what authorities <em>say </em>about
      periods, rather than a thesaurus that seeks to impose consensus about what
      periods <em>are</em>. This is the goal of the Periods, Organized
      (PeriodO) project, for which we are actively seeking funding. Beginning
      with the period assertions collected for sites and regions in GeoDia and a
      set of structured period vocabularies for a large group of Linked Ancient
      World Data projects, PeriodO will present period assertions in an RDF
      encoding that includes the term or label used by the source; a date range
      expressed in Julian Days in scientific notation, with the number of
      significant digits indicating the degree of precision of the start and end
      dates; an associated geographic entity (country, region, or site) from a
      Linked Data gazetteer (<a href="http://pleiades.stoa.org">Pleiades</a>, <a

        href="http://www.wikidata.org">Wikidata</a>, <a href="http://www.geonames.org">GeoNames</a>,
      etc.); and an authoritative source, also linked to a URI, e.g. from <a href="http://viaf.org/">VIAF</a>,
      wherever possible (Figures 4 and 5).</p>

      <figcaption>Figure 5. The same assertion expressed in JSON-LD with dates as Julian
        Days in scientific notation.</figcaption>
    </figure>
        
    <p>We plan to house the repository in Github, at least initially, and to
      mint http DOIs through the <a href="http://n2t.net/ezid">EZID system</a>
      of the California Digital Library. The DOIs will be resolvable to
      structured, machine-readable definitions for individual period assertions
      (Heath and Bizer, 2011). Github will also provide the user-management
      tools to begin to build a community of contributors to the gazetteer: if
      an authoritative user cannot find a URI for a period definition she
      prefers, she will be able to add her own. In the first phase of the
      project, we will create a visualization interface that makes it easier to
      find periods, see their spatial or temporal extent and the degree of
      precision of the latter, and compare different temporal definitions for
      the same period terms or the temporal overlap between different terms.
      Eventually, we hope to build a reconciliation service and a SPARQL
      endpoint that will make it easier to implement period assertion URIs and
      reuse the dataset itself.</p>
    <p>As scholars, we do not talk about periods in the same way that we talk
      about places. With places, we generally tend to agree about the location
      of those that are well-known, and we generally seek to establish consensus
      on the location of those that are ambiguous. With periods, although we
      refer to them in a general way to communicate with each other, we prefer
      to use precise but idiosyncratic definitions that best fit our own
      material. We are also careful to cite the sources of those precise
      definitions, if we did not invent them ourselves: specificity about such
      matters is a basic tenet of scholarly communication. It seems reasonable,
      then, to attempt to mirror scholarly practice in the description of
      periods as Linked Data. The gazetteer PeriodO proposes to create would
      make room for the disagreement, imprecision, and multivocality that
      characterizes scholarly discourse, even while providing URIs for
      structured assertions about periods that include spatiotemporal
      coordinates and authority citations. This approach will not solve all the
      problems that face the implementation of period concepts in the Linked
      Ancient World Data ecosystem, but it does offer a grassroots starting
      point from which we can begin to explore possibilities. The success of
      this effort, like the success of Linked Ancient World Data initiatives in
      general, will depend on the development of a scholarly community of
      practice, with members willing to implement period assertion URIs in their
      own datasets and to contribute new period assertions to a gazetteer.
      Periods are too important to the ways we talk about and conceptualize the
      past to leave out of the Linked Ancient World Data cloud: it really is
      about time.</p>
